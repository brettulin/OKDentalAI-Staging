## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### OpenAI Realtime WebSocket Edge Function
```typescript
// Real-time WebSocket relay with authentication
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.168.0/http/server.ts";

serve(async (req) => {
  const { headers } = req;
  const upgradeHeader = headers.get("upgrade") || "";

  if (upgradeHeader.toLowerCase() !== "websocket") {
    return new Response("Expected WebSocket connection", { status: 400 });
  }

  const { socket, response } = Deno.upgradeWebSocket(req);
  
  // Authenticated relay to OpenAI Realtime API
  const openAISocket = new WebSocket("wss://api.openai.com/v1/realtime");
  
  // Bidirectional message routing with error handling
  // Session management and authentication
  // Real-time audio streaming
});
