  - Added proper intent detection for fallback responses
  - Always ensure calls have valid outcomes from allowed enum values
  - Fixed call management flow in hooks and components

### 2. Call Details Route - âœ… FIXED

- **Solution**: 
  - Created `src/pages/calls/CallDetails.tsx` with full call transcript view
  - Added route `/calls/:id` to App.tsx
  - Updated Calls page to include "View Details" buttons that navigate properly
  - Shows timeline of conversation turns with proper formatting

### 3. AI Settings Configuration - âœ… FIXED
- **Issue**: "Configure AI" button was dead

  - Built `src/pages/settings/AISettings.tsx` for voice & booking configuration
  - Added route `/settings/ai` to App.tsx
  - Updated Settings page with working "Configure AI Settings" button
  - Supports voice provider/model selection, language, transfer number, booking policies

### 4. PMS Dummy Tests - âœ… FIXED

### 5. Appointment Booking QA - âœ… PARTIALLY FIXED
- **Issue**: "Missing required data" errors in QA
- **Solution**:

  - Creates demo patient for booking tests
  - Simplified data structure for reliable QA testing

### 6. Real-time QA Fix - âœ… FIXED
- **Issue**: Invalid UUID "qa-realtime-test" error
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed QA checker to use `crypto.randomUUID()` for proper UUID generation
  - Updated real-time subscription test to use valid UUIDs
  - Proper channel naming and cleanup
